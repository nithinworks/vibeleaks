## 🚀 Deploy to Vercel

### One-Click Deploy

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/nithinworks/vibeleaks)

### Manual Deployment

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (optional)
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

3. **Production Deploy**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Environment Configuration

No environment variables needed! VibeLeaks runs entirely client-side.

The `vercel.json` configuration is already included for:
- ✅ SPA routing (all routes redirect to index.html)
- ✅ Asset caching (1 year cache for static assets)
- ✅ Security headers (CSP, XSS protection, etc.)

## 📖 Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Upload your code**
   - Drag & drop files/folders onto the upload area
   - Or paste code directly into the text area

2. **Start scanning**
   - Click "Scan for Secrets"
   - Watch real-time progress as files are analyzed

3. **Review results**
   - See all detected secrets grouped by severity
   - Click on matches to view file location and code context
   - Filter by severity level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

4. **Export findings**
   - Download results as JSON for automation
   - Export as Markdown for documentation
   - Save as CSV for spreadsheet analysis

### Example: Scanning a Project

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd my-project

# Zip it (or select folder in browser)
zip -r project.zip .

# Upload to VibeLeaks and scan
```
